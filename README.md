This linear regression model is used to predict a stock's future price movement ('target') based on features such as 'reference_price,' 'seconds_in_bucket,' and 'wap.' The choice of linear regression allows for the establishment of a clear and interpretable linear relationship. Cross-validation is employed to assess the model's performance. Feature scaling is performed to normalize input features, ensuring consistent influence. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used as a metric to measure prediction accuracy, a suitable choice for regression tasks. After training the model, an Average MAE of 6.3672 is achieved through 5-fold cross-validation, indicating a reasonable level of accuracy in predicting stock price movements."
